*   You can't create a High Kingdom if you hold Kingdoms outside the
    Empire of your primary title.

    If the creator of a High Kingdom holds other Kingdoms, then they may
    become de-jure the Empire of the new High Kingdom, and have the
    lands of the High Kingdom assigned to them.

    This is why I have put in the potentially arbitrary restriction.

    See feature request 1.

*   The colour of the High Kingdom is based on the primary title of the
    holder, rather than the Empire you're making a High Kingdom of.

    See feature request 2.

*   The old Kingdoms can still be created as Titular Kingdoms.

    See feature request 3.

*   Titular Kingdoms don't contribute towards when the decision appears.

    This may either be a bug or a feature, but I don't have the choice.

    See feature request 3.

Feature Requests
================

1.  A way to obtain a reference to the newly created custom title.

    This isn't needed for the Charlemagne expansion because when going
    up in rank it automatically becomes your primary title.

    I needed to destroy the old Kingdoms and look through all the held
    Kingdoms, which would result in the lands of those Kingdoms going to
    the new High Kingdom, vassalising everyone in that de-jure Kingdom,
    leaving the Kingdom created and making it de-jure the Empire of the
    High Kingdom.

2.  The colour of a newly created custom title is based on the primary
    title of the holder, rather than the title the custom title is
    based on.

    This isn't needed for the Charlemagne expansion because the base
    title is always the same as the primary title.

3.  Checking whether a title is active or changing the active status of
    a title requires it to be explicitly named.

    This is sufficient for base-game, as the events are tied to specific
    titles, but I need to be a lot more dynamic.

    To be able to handle this, I need to be able to pass a reference like
    `PREV` or `THIS` to `is_title_active` and `activate_title`.

4.  Allow the `empire` scope to be used on empire tier titles.

    I need two different decisions to handle making High Kingdom titles
    when I'm an Emperor or a King. If I could get an empire scope from
    an empire then the same logic would fall through.
